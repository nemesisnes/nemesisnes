- 👋 Hi, I’m @nemesisnes (Nemesis NeS, originally known as NeS, NeSone (NeS One), NeStea and Haze (Yeah, the original not the duplicates that has been running around pretending to be me))
- 👀 I’m interested in Gaming, Progamming games, and well, games and women (all men need women in their lives).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UnrealScript, Unreal Engine, Python, Godot, and Objective C, Visual C and C# with C++. (C much >.>)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet, riding solo. (This might change soon enough)
- 📫 How to reach me charles.hamlett.78@gmail.com of charles.hamlett.78@outlook.com
- You can normally find me on UT99.org or at your local Starbucks if you're into drinking insane amounts of coffee and not worried about paying a huge tab (way better than drinking alcohol imo).
