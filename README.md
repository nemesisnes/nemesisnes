- 👋 Hi, I’m @nemesisnes (Nemesis NeS, originally known as NeS, NeSone (NeS One), NeStea and Haze (Yeah, the original not the duplicates that has been running around pretending to be me))
- 👀 I’m interested in Gaming, Progamming games, and well, games and women (all men need women in their lives).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Lua, UnrealScript, Unreal Engine, Python, Godot, and Objective C, Visual C and C# with C++. (C much >.>)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet, riding solo. (This might change soon enough)
- 📫 How to reach me charles.hamlett.78@gmail.com or Telegram +1-646-316-1416 or Twitter: https://twitter.com/XIII_The_Great
- You can normally find me on UT99.org or at your local Starbucks (93rd and 2nd Avenue in NYC) if you're into drinking insane amounts of coffee and not worried about paying a huge tab (way better than drinking alcohol imo). 
- I'm primarily using Solarus-Engine with Lua script and making a small little mini series of Legend of Zelda Spin-offs. The first two will be Book of Mudora and Dark Winds. Also working on an original series as well with a game that I used with RPG Maker 2k3 back in 2005-2008. The Legend of the Philosopher's Stone is getting a brand new story and remake using the Solarus-Engine.
